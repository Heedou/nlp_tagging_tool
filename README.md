# NLP Tagging Tool

Pre-trained language models require downstream tasks. High accuracy can be obtained if the analyst creates the desired training data set and fine-tunes it with the pre-trained language model.
It is a tool designed by python-pyqt5 that allows you to tag and edit text based on the purpose of downstream task.
I have developed a tool to arbitrarily call the text from the user's path, perform tagging based on rules, and then modify it.
Rules can be also modified by adding a dictionary. It is also designed using python-re library.
